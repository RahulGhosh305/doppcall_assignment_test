                <p className='lead'>There are many people beyond firefighters who come into daily contact with firefighting foam and similar fire-retardant chemicals. Persons under significant threat of fire may work in an environment laced with carcinogenic preventative measures. This is especially prevalent in the military, aeronautic, or construction industries.</p>

                <p className='lead'>Exposure does not have to be job-related. Firefighting foam can affect entire communities through drinking water contaminated by chemical runoff. However, most people with a clear link between the contaminant and their condition experienced prolonged exposure.</p>

                <p className='lead'>To qualify, you need to prove that dangerous chemicals from firefighting foam were in your surroundings at high levelsâ€”and that you have a directly related injury.</p>
